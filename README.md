# PROJECT LIBRARY - JAVASCRIPT 

This is a demostration of a library. Users can add their own books
and see then on the browser. They can also add/remove the book and 
lastly change the reading status.

# FEATURES
-  We have a book object that stores data for the Book read or not read by the user.
- The books are stored in an array with the name of My Library.
- We have a function called render that generates the HTML for the books in a table looping the array My Library.
- We have the new book button that shows the form that creates the new book the user wants to put in the main table.
- We have a remove button that removes the record from the table.
- We also have a change status button to update if the user read or not the book.
- Lastly, we added the Local Storage, so the info persists through the refresh of the page.
